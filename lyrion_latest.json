So, for now, this is a brave, post-Logitech (GraciasTotales), new world, and we'd rather try DEV, and hope for the best. (the following text left as is from the original LMS rockon) <h4>Update to newer version</h4><p>Due to some current <a href='https://github.com/rockstor/rockstor-core/issues/2209' target='_blank'>limitations in rock-on networking</a>, the web UI port of this rock-on must be set as 9000 and will thus prevent the installation of other rock-ons needing this port. Alternatively, the web UI can be accessed manually at http://rockstor-ip:9000</p><p>After first installation: to update to a newer stable version, either uninstall/reinstall the Rockon or use the Watchtower Rockon to manage the update of the underlying Media Server image, as it does not automatically update itself during a stop/restart of the Rockon like some other Rockons do. Don't use the update option within the LMS!</p><p>The LMS configuration files will remain in place on the volumes that were specified during the initial installation</p>",
